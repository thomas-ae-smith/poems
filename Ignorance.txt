There's something I don't know;
That I am supposed to know.
I don't know what it is
That I don't know,
And yet am supposed to know;
And I feel I look foolish
If I seem both not to know it
And not know what it is I don't know.

Therefore, I pretend to know it.

This is nerve-wracking. 
Since I don't know what I must pretend to know.
Therefore I pretend to know everything.

I feel *you* know 
What it is that I don't know
But you can't tell me what it is
Because you don't know
That I don't know what it is

You may know *what* it is that I don't know, 
But *not* that I don't know it
And I can't tell you.

So you will 
Have to
Tell me
Everything.
