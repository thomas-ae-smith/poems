A single flow'r he sent me since we met
All tenderly his messenger he chose:
Deep-hearted, pure, with scented dew still wet,
One perfect rose.

I knew the language of the floweret:
'His tender heart', it said, 'my fragile leaves enclose'
Long love has taken for its amulet
One perfect rose.

Why is it no-one ever sent me yet
One perfect limosine do you suppose?
Ah no it's always just my luck to get
One perfect rose.
