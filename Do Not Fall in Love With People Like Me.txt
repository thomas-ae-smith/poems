Do not fall in love with people like me.
I will take you to museums, and parks, and monuments,
And kiss you in every beautiful place,
So that you can never go back to them without tasting me
	Like blood in your mouth.
I will destroy you 
	In the most beautiful way possible.
And when I am gone,
	You will know,
		Why they name storms after people.
