I met a traveller from a distant land,
Who said "Deep in the desert stand
Two vast and trunkless legs of stone.
Nearby, on the sand, half-sunk
A shattered visage lies
Whose frown, and wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
Which yet outlast, stamped on these lifeless things
Both the hand that mocked them and the heart that fed.
And on the pedestal, these words appear:
My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings.
Look upon my works, ye mighty, and despair.

Nothing beside remains. 'round the decay,
Of that colossal wreck, the lone and level sands stretch far away.
