You have to get back on the horse.
Somehow, and I don't know how this sort of thing gets 
started, we have started to lionize horse-not-getting-back-on;
these casual, a priori assertions of inevitable failure that are nothing
more than a gauze draped over your own pulsating terror.
Every creative act is open war against The Way It Is,
what you are saying when you make something is the universe
is not sufficient, that what it really needs is more you.
And it does, actually. It does.
Go look outside - you can't tell me that we are done making the world.


Start yesterday.
And never stop.

 - Tycho Brahe
