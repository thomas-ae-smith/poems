Sometimes things don't go, after all,
From bad to worse. Some years the muscadel
Faces down frost; green thrives, the crops don't fail.
Sometimes a man aims high and all goes well.

A people sometimes will step back from war;
Elect an honest man; decide they care,
Enough that they can't leave some stranger poor.
Some men become what they were born for.

Sometimes our best intentions do not go amiss,
Sometimes we do as we intended. Sometimes the sun
Can melt a field of sorrow that seemed hard frozen.
May it happen for you.
