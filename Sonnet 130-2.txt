My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun,
Coral is far more red than her lips red,
If snow be white why then her breasts are dun, 
If hairs be wires black wires grow from her head.
I have seen roses damask'd, red and white,
But no such roses see I in her cheeks,
And in some perfumes is there more delight,
Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks,
I love to hear her talk, yet well I know
That music hath a far more pleasing sound,
I grant I never saw a goddess go,
My mistress when she walks, walks on the ground.
	And yet, by heaven, I think my love more rare
		Than any she belied by false compare.
