When, in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes,
I all alone beweep my outcast state,
And trouble deaf Heaven with my bootles cries,
And look upon myself and curse my fate.
Wishing me like to him more blessed with hope;
Featured like him, like him with friends possessed,
Desiring this man's art, or that man's scope;
With what I most enjoy contented least.
And, in this state myself almost despising,
Haply I think on thee, and then my state,
Like to the lark at break of day arising,
From sullen earth, sings hymns at Heaven's gate.
For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings,
That then I scorn to change my state with kings.
