Voila, in view, a humble vaudevillian veteran cast vicariously both as victim and villain by the vicissitudes of fate. This visage, no mere veneer of vanity, is a vestige of the vox populi, now vacant, vanished. However, this valorous visitation of a bygone vexation stands vivified, and has vowed to vanquish these venal and virulent vermin, vouchsafing vice and vanguarding the violently vicious and voracious violation of volition. The only verdict is vengeance, a vendetta, held as a votive not in vain, for the value and veracity of which shall one day vindicate the vigilant and the virtuous. Verily, this vichysiosse of verbiage veers most verbose, so let me simply add that it is my very good honour to meet you, and you may call me V.
