The cheetah, my dearest, is not known to cheat,
The tiger possesses no tie,
The horesefly of course, was never a horse,
The lion is not known to lie.

The turkey, though perky, was never a Turk,
The monkey was never a monk,
The mandrill, though like one, was never a man,
Though some men are like him, when drunk.

The springbok, dear thing, was not born in the spring,
The walrus will not build a wall,
All badgers aren't bad, no adder can add,
There is no truth to these things at all.
