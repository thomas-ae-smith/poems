Go placidly amidst the noise and haste,
And remember what peace there may be in silence.
As far as possible without surrender, 
be on good terms with all persons.
Speak your truth quietly, and clearly,
And listen to others, even the dull and the ignorant,
they too have their stories.
Avoid loud and aggressive persons,
they are vexations to the spirit.
If you compare yourself to others, 
you may become vain or bitter,
for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.

Enjoy your achivements, as well as your plans.
Keep interested in your own career, however humble,
it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.
Exercise caution in your business affairs,
for the world is full of trickery,
but let this not blind you to what virtue there is.
Many persons hold high ideals,
and everywhere life is full of heroism.

Be yourself.
Especially, do not feign affection.
But neither be cynical about love,
for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment, 
it is as perennial as the grass.

Take kindly the counsel of the years,
gracefully surrendering the things of youth.
Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune,
but do not distress yourself with dark imaginings,
many fears are born of fatigue, hunger and loneliness.
Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself.

You are a child of the universe, no less
than the trees and the stars.
You have a right to be here,
and whether or not it is clear to you,
no doubt the universe is unfolding precisely as it should.

Therefore be at peace with life, whatever you concieve it to be,
and whatever your labours or aspirations in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with yoru soul.
For all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world.
Be careful; strive to be happy.
