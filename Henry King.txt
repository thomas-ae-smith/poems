The chief defect of Henry King,
Was chewing little bits of string
One day he swallowed some which tied
Itself in ugly knots inside.
Physicians of the utmost fame
Were called at once, but when they came
They answered as they took their fees:
"There is no cure for this disease - 
Henry will very soon be dead."

His parents gathered 'round his bed
Lamenting his untimely death
When Henry, with his latest breath
Cried: "Oh my friends be warned by me
That Breakfast, Dinner, Lunch and Tea
Are all the human frame requires!"
...with that, the wretched child expires.
