To love at all is to be vulnerable
Love anything, and you heart will cvertainly be wrung and possibly be broken.
If you want to be sure to keep it safe, you must give your heart to no-one, not even to an animal.
Keep  it safe in the casket of your chest, wrapped around with hobbies and trinkets and little baubles.
But in that casket, safe, motionless, airless, it will change.
It will not break; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable.

 - C.S. Lewis
