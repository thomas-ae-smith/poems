Mathilda told such dreadful lies,
It made one gasp, and stretch one's eyes.
Her aunt, who from her earliest youth,
Had kept a strict regard for truth,
Attempted to believe Mathilda
 - the efford very nearly killed her,
 and would have done so had not she
 discovered this infirmity.

For once, approaching close of day,
Mathilda, growing tired of play
And finding she was left alone
Went tiptoe to the telephone
And summoned the immediate aid
Of London's noble Fire Brigade.

Within an hour the gallant band
Came pouring in from 'cross the land
From Putney, Hackney Downs and Bow,
With courage high and hearts a-glow
They galloped roaring through the town:
"Mathilda's house is burning down!"
Inspired by British cheers and loud
Proceedings from the frenzied crowd
They ran their ladders through a score
Of windows on the Ballroom floor
And took peculiar pains to souse
The paintings up and down the house
Until Mathilda's aunt suceeded
In showing them they were not needed
(and even then she had to pay
to get the men to go away).

It happened that a few weeks later
Her aunt was off to the Theatre
To see that entertaining play
'The Second Mrs. Tanqueray'.
She had declined to take her niece
To see this entertaining piece;
A deprivation Just and Wise
To punish her for telling lies.

That night a fire did break out
You should have heard Mathilda shout
You should have heard her scream and bawl
And throw the windows up and call
To people passing in the street
(the rapidly increasing heat
encouraging her to obtain
their confidence) but all in vain.
For every time she shouted "Fire!"
They only answered "Little liar!"
And therefore, when her aunt returned,
Mathilda, and the house, were burned.
